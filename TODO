- When you are on the table view of files, the column `Albums` doesn't get populated unless you fetch them, obviously.
	- Think of a strategy to achieve this in a nice manner

- There's nowhere to rename albums
- Finish /dashboard/tags - right now all it does is ask if you want to delete a tag (make it like the albums page)
- Make the settings page work properly
- Add an stats page that displays statistics about the server like free space, free/used memory, etc
	- Add statistics of total disk space used by a specific user (?)
	- Page that lists all files ordered by size, useful to find big files

- databaseMigration.js generates thumbnails, make it use the ThumbUtil.js functions for consistency
- Add pagination to user files
- Add pagination to public album links
