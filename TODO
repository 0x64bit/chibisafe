- There's a vertical scrollbar on seemingly all pages even though there is no need for it
- "Tags" button on dashboard 404s
- Passwords that contain special characters don't seem to work (refer to previous dms)


- Uploaded text file (via ShareX) does not show up in the dashboard's "Files" area
	* Currently only pictures show up on the dashboard due to having thumbs

- Tags button when hovering over an image in the "Files" section do nothing


- Album options don't always seem to work? Sometimes I need to toggle an option on and off again for it to take effect (both dis-/enabled and downloads)
	* This is an issue with SQLite not supporting boolean fields, they get converted to 1 and 0
- Users section on dashboard doesn't properly display the Enabled / Admin options (shows both as false for my admin account, the only one that exists)
	* This is an issue with SQLite not supporting boolean fields, they get converted to 1 and 0
- Same as above happens even when the album link is disabled, (dis-)allow download makes no difference
	* This is an issue with SQLite not supporting boolean fields, they get converted to 1 and 0

    - Invalidate a file after it has been downloaded/viewed.
