- FAQ 404s
- There's a vertical scrollbar on seemingly all pages even though there is no need for it
- "Upload files" button on the dashboard doesn't do anything
- "Tags" button on dashboard 404s
- Passwords that contain special characters don't seem to work (refer to previous dms)

- Users section on dashboard doesn't properly display the Enabled / Admin options (shows both as false for my admin account, the only one that exists)
    * This is an issue with SQLite not supporting boolean fields, they get converted to 1 and 0

- Purge files button in Users section doesn't seem to do anything (files remain in uploads folder)
- Trying to access an album link seems to load endlessly if the album contains no images

- Same as above happens even when the album link is disabled, (dis-)allow download makes no difference
    * This is an issue with SQLite not supporting boolean fields, they get converted to 1 and 0

- You can only disable but not delete album links, so if you make five you're stuck with those 5 forever
- There is no tab name (just shows the web address) and no favicon (blank), even though instance name was set to "lolisafe" in wizard
- "Classic mode for store/ is deprecated and will be removed in Nuxt 3."
- Uploaded text file (via ShareX) does not show up in the dashboard's "Files" area
    * Currently only pictures show up on the dashboard due to having thumbs

- Albums and Tags buttons when hovering over an image in the "Files" section do nothing
    * Album is fixed
    * Tags is not

- On the front page, the top left logo and text for lolisafe is very hard to read
    * Not gonna bother with this, anyone can upload their own background and it's different on every screen resolution
- Can't find a button to delete an album

- Clicking on an album name leads to a 404 (e.g. https://i.robflop.me/dashboard/albums/1)
- When toggling album options, it says "Editing the link was successfull", the 2nd l should be removed
- Album options don't always seem to work? Sometimes I need to toggle an option on and off again for it to take effect (both dis-/enabled and downloads)
    * Might be related to SQLite not supporting boolean fields issue
