- There's a vertical scrollbar on seemingly all pages even though there is no need for it
- "Tags" button on dashboard 404s
- Passwords that contain special characters don't seem to work (refer to previous dms)


- Uploaded text file (via ShareX) does not show up in the dashboard's "Files" area
	* Currently only pictures show up on the dashboard due to having thumbs

- Tags button when hovering over an image in the "Files" section do nothing

    - Invalidate a file after it has been downloaded/viewed.
